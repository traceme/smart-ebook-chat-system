# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Security Measures
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 5, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop comprehensive security measures including encryption, authentication, authorization, and vulnerability scanning.
# Details:
Implement security measures:

1. Data Security:
   - Implement AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
   - Set up PBKDF2 key derivation
   - Create secure storage for API keys
   - Implement data isolation

2. Authentication & Authorization:
   - Enhance JWT implementation
   - Create role-based access control
   - Implement IP-based restrictions
   - Build audit logging

3. Network Security:
   - Set up TLS configuration
   - Implement API rate limiting
   - Create WAF rules
   - Build DDoS protection

4. Vulnerability Management:
   - Set up dependency scanning
   - Implement SAST/DAST
   - Create security testing
   - Build vulnerability disclosure process

Implement OWASP Top 10 protections. Create security documentation and incident response procedures.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test encryption implementation
2. Verify authentication security
3. Test authorization controls
4. Validate rate limiting
5. Test dependency scanning
6. Verify SAST/DAST integration
7. Test security headers
8. Validate audit logging for security events
