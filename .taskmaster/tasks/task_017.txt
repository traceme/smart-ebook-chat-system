# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Testing Framework
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 11, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive testing framework with unit, integration, E2E, and performance tests.
# Details:
Implement testing framework:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Set up pytest for backend
   - Implement react-testing-library for frontend
   - Create mock services and data
   - Build test utilities

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up API testing framework
   - Implement database integration tests
   - Create service integration tests
   - Build end-to-end flows

3. E2E Testing:
   - Set up Playwright for E2E tests
   - Implement critical user journeys
   - Create visual regression tests
   - Build accessibility tests

4. Performance Testing:
   - Set up Locust for load testing
   - Implement benchmark tests
   - Create scalability tests
   - Build stress tests

Aim for >80% test coverage for core functionality. Implement CI pipeline integration for automated testing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify unit test coverage meets targets
2. Test integration test reliability
3. Validate E2E test coverage of critical paths
4. Test performance testing accuracy
5. Verify CI pipeline integration
6. Test reporting and visualization
7. Validate test isolation and independence
8. Verify test performance and execution time
