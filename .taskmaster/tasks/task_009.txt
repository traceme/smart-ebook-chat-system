# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Semantic Search and Retrieval
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the semantic search API with vector similarity search, reranking, and context window construction.
# Details:
Implement semantic search and retrieval:

1. Backend:
   - Create vector similarity search endpoint
   - Implement BGE reranker integration
   - Set up context window construction
   - Create reference extraction and formatting
   - Implement search filters
   - Set up search analytics

2. Frontend:
   - Build search interface
   - Create search results visualization
   - Implement search filters UI
   - Add search history
   - Create search suggestions

Implement k=8 initial retrieval followed by reranking with bge-reranker-base. Extract page references and construct appropriate context windows for LLM processing.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test search accuracy with known documents
2. Verify reranking improves result quality
3. Measure search performance against KPI targets
4. Test reference extraction accuracy
5. Validate context window construction
6. Test search with various query types
7. Verify search filters work correctly
8. Measure Top-3 retrieval accuracy against 92% target

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Vector Similarity Search Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint that performs vector similarity search against the document embeddings database.
### Details:
Develop a REST endpoint that accepts search queries, converts them to embeddings using the same model used for document indexing, and performs a k-nearest neighbors search (k=8) against the vector database. Return the top k results with their similarity scores and metadata. Use an efficient vector database like FAISS, Pinecone, or Milvus for the implementation.

## 2. Integrate BGE Reranker [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement the BGE reranker integration to improve search result relevance by reordering the initial vector search results.
### Details:
Use the bge-reranker-base model to rerank the initial k=8 results from the vector search. The reranker should take both the original query and each retrieved passage, compute a relevance score, and reorder the results accordingly. Implement caching to avoid recomputing scores for identical query-passage pairs. Ensure the reranker API is properly integrated with the search endpoint.

## 3. Implement Context Window Construction [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create a system to construct appropriate context windows from the retrieved and reranked search results for LLM processing.
### Details:
Develop logic to combine the reranked search results into a coherent context window for the LLM. Implement strategies for handling context length limitations, such as truncation or summarization. Include metadata about each passage's source. Ensure the context window maintains the reranked order of importance and preserves document boundaries where appropriate.

## 4. Create Reference Extraction and Formatting [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Implement a system to extract and format page references and citations from search results.
### Details:
Develop functionality to extract page numbers, section titles, and other reference information from the search results. Create a standardized format for presenting these references to users. Implement logic to deduplicate references and merge adjacent page references. Ensure references are linked back to the original documents for verification.

## 5. Implement Search Filters and Analytics [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Add filtering capabilities to the search API and implement analytics tracking for search queries and results.
### Details:
Extend the search API to support filtering by document metadata (date, author, category, etc.). Implement server-side filtering logic that works efficiently with vector search. Create an analytics system to track search queries, clicked results, and search performance metrics. Store analytics data in a structured format for later analysis.

## 6. Build Search Interface and Results Visualization [done]
### Dependencies: 9.4, 9.5
### Description: Develop the frontend search interface with results visualization, filters UI, search history, and suggestions.
### Details:
Create a responsive search interface with an input box, filters panel, and results display. Implement results visualization that highlights matching text and shows relevance scores. Add a search history feature that stores recent searches. Develop search suggestions based on partial input and popular searches. Ensure the UI provides clear access to reference information and context.
