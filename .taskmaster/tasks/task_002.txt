# Task ID: 2
# Title: Setup Backend Project Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the FastAPI backend project with proper structure, database configurations, Celery setup, and Docker development environment.
# Details:
Create a FastAPI project with the following structure and configurations:
1. Set up project layout:
   - app/
     - routers/
     - services/
     - models/
     - workers/
     - schemas/
     - core/
     - main.py
2. Configure pydantic-settings for environment and configuration management
3. Set up database models and SQLAlchemy ORM
4. Configure Alembic for database migrations
5. Set up Celery for asynchronous task processing
6. Create Docker Compose configuration for development environment including:
   - FastAPI service
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Redis for Celery and caching
   - Qdrant for vector storage
   - MinIO/S3 compatible storage
7. Configure logging with OpenTelemetry
8. Set up dependency management with uv
9. Create basic health check endpoints

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify Docker Compose setup works correctly
2. Test database connection and migrations
3. Validate Celery worker connects and processes tasks
4. Check health endpoints return correct status
5. Verify logging configuration captures appropriate information
6. Test environment variable configuration loading
