# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Document Upload Service
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the document upload service with chunked uploads, resumable transfers, deduplication, and progress tracking.
# Details:
Implement document upload service:

1. Backend:
   - Create S3/MinIO integration for storage
   - Implement presigned URL generation
   - Set up SHA-256 deduplication checking
   - Create document metadata storage
   - Implement upload status tracking
   - Set up WebSocket for progress updates
   - Configure virus scanning integration

2. Frontend:
   - Build chunked upload component (5MB chunks)
   - Implement drag-and-drop interface
   - Create resumable upload logic
   - Add progress visualization
   - Implement retry mechanism
   - Create file type validation

Support multiple file formats: PDF, EPUB, TXT, DOCX. Implement proper error handling for network interruptions and file validation failures.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test chunked upload with various file sizes
2. Verify resumable uploads work after interruption
3. Test deduplication with identical files
4. Validate progress reporting accuracy
5. Test concurrent uploads
6. Verify file type validation
7. Test error handling for invalid files
8. Measure upload performance against KPI targets
