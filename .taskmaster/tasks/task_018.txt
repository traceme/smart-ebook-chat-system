# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Deployment Configuration
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2, 16, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop deployment configurations for Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines.
# Details:
Implement deployment configuration:

1. Docker:
   - Create multi-stage Dockerfiles for frontend and backend
   - Implement docker-compose for local development
   - Build production-ready images
   - Create image optimization

2. Kubernetes:
   - Implement Kubernetes manifests
   - Create Helm charts
   - Build autoscaling configuration
   - Implement resource limits and requests

3. CI/CD:
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows
   - Implement testing pipeline
   - Create deployment pipeline
   - Build release management

4. Infrastructure as Code:
   - Implement Terraform configurations
   - Create AWS/GCP/Azure templates
   - Build environment management
   - Implement secret management

Ensure configurations support development, staging, and production environments. Implement proper security practices throughout.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Docker builds in CI environment
2. Verify Kubernetes deployments
3. Test CI/CD pipelines
4. Validate infrastructure provisioning
5. Test environment isolation
6. Verify secret management
7. Test deployment rollbacks
8. Validate resource scaling

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Multi-stage Dockerfiles [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop optimized multi-stage Dockerfiles for both the FastAPI backend and Gatsby frontend applications
### Details:
Create production-ready multi-stage Dockerfiles that minimize image size and enhance security:

1. Backend Dockerfile:
   - Use Python slim image as base
   - Create separate stages for dependencies and runtime
   - Install and build dependencies in build stage
   - Copy only necessary files to runtime stage
   - Set proper user permissions and non-root user
   - Configure health checks

2. Frontend Dockerfile:
   - Use Node.js image for build stage
   - Build Gatsby static site
   - Use nginx:alpine for serving static files
   - Configure nginx with proper caching headers
   - Implement gzip compression
   - Set up proper security headers

## 2. Enhance Docker Compose Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Improve the existing docker-compose setup for development, staging, and production environments
### Details:
Enhance the existing docker-compose configuration to support multiple environments:

1. Development (docker-compose.dev.yml):
   - Hot reloading for both frontend and backend
   - Debug configurations
   - Volume mounts for source code
   - Development database with test data

2. Staging (docker-compose.staging.yml):
   - Production-like configuration
   - SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Performance monitoring enabled

3. Production (docker-compose.prod.yml):
   - Optimized for performance
   - Health checks and restart policies
   - Resource limits and reservations
   - Security hardening

## 3. Create Kubernetes Deployment Manifests [done]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop Kubernetes deployment manifests for all application components
### Details:
Create comprehensive Kubernetes manifests for production deployment:

1. Application Deployments:
   - Backend API deployment with replica sets
   - Frontend deployment with nginx serving
   - Celery worker deployment with auto-scaling
   - Database deployments with persistent volumes

2. Services and Networking:
   - LoadBalancer/NodePort services
   - Ingress controllers with SSL termination
   - Network policies for security
   - Service mesh configuration (optional)

3. Configuration Management:
   - ConfigMaps for application settings
   - Secrets for sensitive data
   - Environment-specific configurations
   - Persistent Volume Claims for storage
