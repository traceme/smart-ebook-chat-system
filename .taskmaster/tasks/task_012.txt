Implement Gmail-style layout components:

1. Core Layout:
   - Create top navigation bar with search
   - Implement left sidebar with document list
   - Build main content area
   - Create right drawer for settings
   - Implement responsive breakpoints (â‰¥360px)

2. Components:
   - Build document list with virtual scrolling
   - Create tag tree with collapsible sections
   - Implement search bar with autocomplete
   - Build user menu and settings panel
   - Create document preview with lazy loading
   - Implement chat panel with Markdown support

Use MUI v6 components with Gmail theme customization. Implement Framer Motion for animations. Ensure keyboard navigation support throughout the interface.

# Test Strategy:
1. Test responsive behavior at various breakpoints
2. Verify keyboard navigation works correctly
3. Test virtual scrolling with large document lists
4. Validate lazy loading of document previews
5. Test animations and transitions
6. Verify theme consistency across components
7. Test accessibility compliance
8. Verify component rendering performance
